1. How would you suggest we value this property based on the data provided in the excel
(“Sold Properties_Example”)?

After removing outliers from a certain tolerance we can take an average of the "Sold Price / Size of Property (Sqft)"
of similarly dated buildings that are also terraced then multiply that by 1200.
This should give us a decently rounded estimate as those are the characteristics with the most weight on the price.

2. What challenges or risks do you see in your proposed valuation method?

There is still limited information on other factors of the properties. Attributes such as condition, parking 
and public transport proximity aren't in the spreadsheet but could bear a lot of weight on the property.
We haven't accommodated for inflation or other changes in the market landscape. 
These events could cause large dips or fluctuations in the price of a property. The dataset is still limited and 
we could increase the scope of years and adjust for inflation to increase our chance at finding outliers. 

3. What further information would help you have greater confidence in your valuation of the
property?

Key facts about the property itself such as the aforementioned condition, parking, garden, insulation and window direction.
We can actually use the location to find out proximity to important landmarks such as public transport, schools and parks.
A professional opinion could help so we could look at other properties currently being listed in that area and see what 
they're selling for.
